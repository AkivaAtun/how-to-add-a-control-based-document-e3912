# How To: Add A Control-Based Document


<p>This example shows how a control can be added to DocumentManager as a document. The application creates a new RichEditControl and docks it as a tab to DocumentManager each time the 'Add Tabbed Document' button is clicked. A click on the 'Add Float Document' button results in adding a floating document that contains a new RichEditControl object. For every RichEditControl a Document object is created. <br />
A click on the 'Remove All' button closes all documents within the view.<br />
The DocumentManager uses a TabbedView UI.</p>
